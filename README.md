# Impression
Impression, a VR application, is currently under development in Unity and written in C#, undertaken at MangoHacks!!

Impression uses IBM's Bluemix Watson API, allowing us to harness the awesome computing power of Watson to accomplish great things. 
It all begins by passing in poetry through to a script written using the Watson API, which then allows Watson to process the word play, word order, and tone, and returns to us meaningful data that we can 
use to display imagery on-screen (well, in headset.) 

This application, in its final finished state, could allow for easier accessibility to the learning of literary and poetic analysis, for example, in AP Literature high school classes, or even to help the developmentally disabled. 

Under development by Kevin Robbins and Ryan Diaz, 2017
